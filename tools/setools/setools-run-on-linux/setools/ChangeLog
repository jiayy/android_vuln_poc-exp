*setools-4.2.1 (4 Feb 2019)

  * Set SIGPIPE handler for CLI tools.
  * Fixed alias dereferencing in TypeQuery and type, category, and sensitivity
    lookups.
  * Fixed sediff bug for rendering modified nodecons.
  * Fixed devicetreecon count output.
  * Fixed policy target platform check.
  * Fixed bug in creating permission set intersection in apol.


*setools-4.2.0 (10 Nov 2018)

  This release focused on improving performance and reducing memory usage.

  A Cython-based policy representation replaced the
  Python/SWIG/static-linked-libsepol implemention. SETools no longer statically
  links to libsepol, though it is strongly suggested that users rebuild SETools
  after updating libsepol, in case the policy structure changes.

  Building on the policy representation change, refinements in sediff yielded
  as much as a 90% reduction in memory use, depending on the policies.

  This release of SETools has different dependencies than previous versions.
  See README.md for more details.  Support for Python 2.7 was dropped because
  all current SELinux-supporting distributions provide Python 3.

  Other smaller changes included:

  * Added support for SCTP portcons.
  * Updated permission maps.
  * Policy symbol names are now available as the name attribute (e.g.
    Boolean.name, Type.name, etc.)
  * Revised some apol layouts to increase the size of text entry fields.
  * Revised package structure to make policyrep a module of the setools
    package.
  * Moved constraint expression to its own class.
  * Made Conditional.evaluate() more useful and added BaseTERule.enabled()
    method to determine if a rule is enabled.

  Changes since v4.2.0-rc:

  * Restored missing statement() methods in some policyrep classes
  * Fixed NULL pointer dereference when iterating over type attributes when
    the policy has none.
  * Added xdp_socket permission mapping.


*setools-4.2.0-rc (29 Sep 2018)

  Changes since v4.2.0-beta:

  * Fixed performance regressions.
  * Made further memory usage improvements.
  * Fixed build issues with clean target and runtime_library_dirs.
  * Revised package structure to make policyrep a module of the setools
    package.
  * Symbol names are now available as the name attribute (e.g.
    Boolean.name, Type.name, etc.)
  * Fixed some apol layouts to increase the size of text fields.
  * Move constraint expression to its own class.
  * Made Conditional.evaluate() more useful and added BaseTERule.enabled()
    method to determine if a rule is enabled.


*setools-4.2.0-beta (10 Jul 2018)

  Changes since v4.1.1:

  * Replaced the Python/SWIG/static-linked-libsepol policyrep module with
    a Cython implementation. This will have performance and memory-usage
    improvements and breaks the static linking to libsepol.
  * Significant memory usage reduction in sediff (approximately 60%,
    depending on the policies).
  * Added support for SCTP portcons.
  * Updated permission maps.
  * Support for Python 2.7 was dropped.

  This release of SETools has changed dependencies since 4.1.1. See README.md for more details.


*setools-4.1.1 (5 Aug 2017)

  This release has three changes since 4.1.0:

  * Update for libsepol 2.7
  * Update to permission maps
  * Fixes for apol help files


*setools-4.1.0 (23 Jan 2017)

  This release primarily focused on adding features to apol, but has several
  library enhancements. There is also one important bugfix in sediff. There
  were no changes since 4.1.0-rc.

  Note This will not compile on the master branch of libsepol (what will
  be libsepol 2.7). A future release of SETools will have this support
  (when libsepol 2.7 is released).


*setools-4.1.0-rc (11 Dec 2016)

  Library:
  * Implemented support for alternate install prefixes.
  * Implemented support for building setools with a locally-built libsepol.
  * Fixed an sediff bug with unioning rules after expansion.
  * Improved sediff memory usage.
  * Patch from Nicolas Iooss to make more stable output in TE rule permission lists.
  * Replaced string representations (e.g. rule types) with enumerations.
    Requires the enum34 (not enum) Python package if using Python < 3.4.

  Apol:
  * Implemented context menu option for exporting the information flow
    and domain transition analysis tree browser views.
  * Implemented CSV export of table results.
  * Implemented (clipboard) copy from table results.
  * Added missing "clear" button in object class query.
  * Implemented save/load settings for tabs.
  * Implemented save/load workspace (save all tabs settings).
  * Fixed include/exclude type dialog to keep its place when
    adding or removing types from an analysis.
  * Implemented filter on include/exclude type dialog to filter
    the lists by attribute.


*setools-4.0.1 (17 May 2016)

  Library:
  * Fixed a compile error on 32bit systems.
  * Changed domain transition analysis output to use lists instead
    of generators.  This fixes a display problem in apol's DTA browser.

  Apol:
  * Replaced icons with stock Qt icons to remove license issues
    with some distributions.

  Sesearch:
  * Changed xperm options to bring in line with sediff, e.g. --allowx
    changed to --allowxperm.  Python's argument parser will still detect
    --allowx as an abbreviation of --allowxperm, so compatibility is preserved.


*setools-4.0.0 (04 May 2016)

  First 4.0 release.  SETools is reimplemented in Python.
