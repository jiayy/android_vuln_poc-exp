This is the poc of vulnerability (CVE-2018-18281)[https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1695] 

I test the poc in pixel2 with fingerprint: google/walleye/walleye:9/PQ1A.181105.017.A1/5081125:user/release-keys

In order to run this poc, 

- run make 
- adb push /libs/arm64-v8a/poc /data/local/tmp/
- adb push /libs/arm64-v8a/runpoc /data/local/tmp/
- run /data/local/tmp/runpoc  in the target device

If everything is ok, it may print as follow:

```bash
$ sudo ./poc
try triggerring..
........
GOT 0x0000000000000000
Segmentation fault
```

poc.old.c is a little different with poc.c, it pin the idle worker thread to the same cpu core with the mremap thread, otherwise poc.c pin the idle worker thread to a different cpu core(and a busy working thread is pinned to this core as well), in my test, poc.c will hit the race condition much easier than poc.old.c
